# 2022 Web Development Learnings
This repository showcases the projects and exercises that reflect the skills I've developed in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap throughout 2022. These projects were created as part of the coursework from Laura Chuburu's courses, where I learned essential techniques for building responsive and visually appealing websites.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring web content.
CSS3: For designing the layout and styling of web pages.
Bootstrap: For creating responsive, mobile-first web designs.

### Learning Journey
Laura Chuburu's courses helped me:

- Improve my understanding of semantic HTML.
- Master CSS selectors, properties, and layouts.
- Utilize Bootstrap components to streamline front-end development.
Feel free to explore the code, analyze the techniques, and provide feedback!
